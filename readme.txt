Panini is a modern framework for quick development of streaming microservices. Our goal is to create fastapi/aiohttp/flask-like solution but for NATS streaming.
â€¨
The framework allows you to work with NATS features and some additional logic using a simple interface:

- publish messages to subject
- subscribe to subject
- request-response
- request-response to another topic
- tasks
- periodic tasks
- HTTP server
